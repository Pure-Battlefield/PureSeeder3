- the installer can be downloaded from [http://pure-battlefield.github.io/PureSeeder3/](http://pure-battlefield.github.io/PureSeeder3/)
- we don't have a proper signing key for the installation so Windows may block the installation saying "Windows protected your PC"
- the install is NOT harmful so if you choose trust us (or you want to verify the source code yourself), you can choose to install it anyway by clicking on the "More info" link below the message, then clicking on the "Run Anyway" button that appears in the lower right hand corner.

#### Notes for Developers
- when committing code in git, please ensure that git does not automatically deal with line endings for this repository
   - this will cause the hash that is generated by the ClickOnce deployment to not match the actual hash of the application and the application will not install
   - use this command to turn of automatic handling of line endings in your current repository
   - `$git config core.autocrlf false`
   -  more info on line endings in git can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings)
