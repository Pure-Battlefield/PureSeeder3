#### Notes for Developers
- when committing code in git, please ensure that git does not automatically deal with line endings for this repository
   - this will cause the hash that is generated by the ClickOnce deployment to not match the actual hash of the application and the application will not install
   - use this command to turn of automatic handling of line endings in your current repository
   - `$git config core.autocrlf false`
   -  more info on line endings in git can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings)
